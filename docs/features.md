## Features 🌟

- **Automatic Generation**: Automatically generate documentation comments for classes, modules, and packages by parsing the Python Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), feeding the relevant key code to AI, and using the Google Docstrings template to generate precise comments. 🛠️
- **Smart Translation**: Translate existing comments, supporting multiple languages. The input can be a Python package, module, or class. If it's a package, it will parse the syntax tree layer by layer, perform source code injection, and inject comments into the source code. 🌐
- **Comment Polishing**: Use AI technology to polish comments for improved readability. A small but powerful feature. 📖✨
- **Flexible Customization**: Easily customize all comments across the entire repository. This framework-level functionality has low-level API extensibility. 🔧
